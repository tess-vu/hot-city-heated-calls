# NIGHT TIME HEAT & VIOLENCE IN PHILADELPHIA

How do satellite-derived heat (ECOSTRESS LST) and urban greening (tree canopy) interact to influence violent crime counts at the block group level in Philadelphia, after controlling for socio-demographic vulnerability and built-environment density?

- Hypothesis 1: Higher LST associated with higher rates of violent crime.

- Hypothesis 2: Higher tree canopy or LSTE percentage associated with lower rates of violent crime.

- Hypothesis 3: Crime-mitigating effect of tree canopy will be most pronounced in the hottest areas.
